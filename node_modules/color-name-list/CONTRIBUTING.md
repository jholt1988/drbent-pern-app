# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Adding colors

1. Only update the `src/colornames.csv` file and run `npm run build` or Request access to our shared google spreadsheet
2. Make sure the name(s) you commit are not racist or offensive or a protected brand name. (No Facebook Blue, Cocacola red etc.., no Natinality + Tan etc..)
3. Read the "Rules for new color names"
4. Make sure the name nor the hex value are already in use. `npm run test` will test that for you.
5. Update the README.md with the source of your colors, unless you invented that color, in this case add your self to the contributors in the README.md

## Rules for new color names

- No duplicate names or hex values.
- No racist names
- No offensive names
- No obscene names ðŸ’©
- No protected brand-names (`Facebook Blue`, `Twitter Blue`)
- No enumerations (`Grey 1`, `Grey 2`, `Grey 3`, `Grey 4`)
- British English spelling (ex. `Grey` not `Gray`), unless its something U.S. typical.
- Capitalize colors: `Kind of Orange`
- Prefer common names, especially when adding colors form the flora and fauna (flowers and animals ;) ) ex. `Venus Slipper Orchid` instead of `Paphiopedilum`.
